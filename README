# Introduction

Compute eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of the linearized perturbation equations with a prescribed background state.

# Scripts:

1. `plot_komega_from_solar.py`: construct and plot a k-omega diagram using the background state from Solar Model S.

1. `plot_komega_from_sim.py`: construct and plot a k-omega diagram using the background state from a simulation of convection.

1. `plot_mode_from_sim.py`: find an plot a single eigenfunction using the background from a simulation of convection. Initial guess for the eigenfunction and eigenfrequency should be changed by modifying the script.

1. `problem.py`: find an plot a single eigenfunction using Solar Model S as the background state. Initial guess for the eigenfunction and eigenfrequency should be changed by modifying the script.
